        <p>Python Clutch aims to be a fast resource for Python developers to compare Python packages on objective metrics like development history and adoption. <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/">ruby-toolbox.com</a> provides a similar service for Ruby developers, but this year's Python cohort had no way to evaluate the merits of alternative packages without either extensive research or hours of trial and error. By aggregating info from PyPi and source code repositories, Python Clutch helps Pythonistas quickly find packages that address their problems and that have a balance of wide adoption and active development.</p>
        <h2 class="about-heading about-heading-score">How is the score calculated?</h2>
        <p>We pull information from the Python Package Index and online source repositories, and use information from those APIs to measure adoption (through pip downloads) and developer interest. We then weight those raw scores by time elapsed since the last activity on the project. The final score is then calculated relative to the best packages in our databases, and displayed as a number in the range 0 to 10.</p>

                <h3>Joel Thompson</h3>
                <p class="developer-p">Well hello there… I am a graduate of the Iron Yard Academy where I specialized in Python development with a special interest in back-end web support. Designing databases and APIs really gets my brain juices flowing. When I’m not spending my time managing the back-end of Python Clutch with my comrades I enjoy writing, producing and listening to music. I also have a passion for classic Kung-Fu cinema and long walks on the beach.

                <p class="developer-p">Python Engineering graduate, I transferred from working in Medical testing field. There I discovered that once I was done mastering the skills required to do my job I grew bored. Wanting to continue learning a building my skill set I decided to go to a new career where I will have to keep learning and constantly building new awesome things! Things that I’ve especially loved learning to do with Python are: creating APIs, data analysis with pandas, and building apps with Flask.</p>

                <p class="developer-p">I am a graduate of <a class="link" href="academy.smashingboxes.com">The Iron Yard powered by Smashing Boxes</a> in Durham, NC. I was on the Front End Engineering track with the goal of graduating as a junior front end developer on April 3, 2015. I like to think I did that! While in school, I learned HTML5, CSS3, UX/UI principles, JavaScript, jQuery, rLite, node.js, JSONP, AJAX, and AngularJS. I am currently looking to begin my career as a front end developer so if you're looking to hire, let me know!</p>
