# The Python Clutch!
[The Python Clutch](pythonclutch.com) is a(n opinonated) site designed to help Python developers pick packages for their projects.

## Testing Notes
Before running tests, run ```createdb testdb```, to make the testing database. (We use Postgres, so thats another prerequisite.)

## Personal Access Keys
To create a personal access key, go to https://github.com/settings/applications#personal-access-tokens and make one.
Then, assuming you've installed direnv, run ```echo export GITKEY=<thekeyyougenerate> > .envrc```
We'll figure out how to use it to do API calls in a bit.
